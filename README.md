## ! Warning ! 
## This is not a legal way to change the theme for the WiiU, I share these files with the idea that you have the knowledge of how to install these themes safely. I am not held responsible for any system bricks caused by these files.
These files are not a direct way to get custom themes, you have to use [Theme-Manager](https://github.com/Xpl0itU/theme-manager) to install them.
This repo is just a collection of themes i have found online and want to share in one place.
## ^ ! Warning! ^

## How to install themes:
Put the Men.pack and Men2.pack files of the theme in sd:/wiiu/themes/[theme name]

Put theme_manager.rpx in sd:/wiiu/apps

Run the homebrew

Select the theme

Profit!
